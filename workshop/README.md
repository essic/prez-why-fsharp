# F# Workshop

## Project structure

1. __api-definition__ folder contains the open-api spec file __clock-or-die.yaml__ which defines the api.
1. __src__ file contains code related to the project

### Pre-requisite

This project uses :
- [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
- _F# 6_, which is included in the SDK, however, you can check this [website]() for more information.
_ We also use the currently available preview of _C# 10_. I recomand using the [EAP version of Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/nextversion/) due to some issues at the time of I am writing this (.NET 6 just got out and VS2022 on some OS have issues). You can either use [Visual Studio 2022 Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/vs/preview/) or [Ionide using VsCode](https://ionide.io/) and some plugins for __C#__ . 
- If you plan on modifying this workshop, you also need to install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as well as [.NET 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/2.1)

### For those who wish to setup the workshop

From the current folder, run the following:
1. `dotnet tool restore` to restore [paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/) tool use to handle project's dependencies.
1. `dotnet restore` to restore project dependencies

### For those who plan on modifying the API

Again you do not need to modify the api for this workshop, instructions below is for information.

The API part is generated from the openAPI (3.0) spec file __api-definition/clock-or-die.yaml__ using the tool __nswag__. All controllers and DTOs are generated by this tool.

In order to modify the API part of the project, you need to update the spec and then generate the code using the __nswag cli__.

To install the tool, I recommend using npm. _Make sure that you have the .net2.1 SDK on your machine before running the tool._ In the current folder run:
1. `npm i -g nswag` this will install nswag globally on your machine
1. `nswag run` this will generate the code using the config file __nswag.json__, all code generated will be in the file __src/ClockOrDie.WebApi/Controllers/CodeGen/CodeGenClockOrDieController.cs__

__PLEASE NOTE:__ _If you change the name of the output file, you will need to adjust the project accordingly_

## Let's code F# !

In this workshop, we will code a very simple __Time Tracker__ API, in order to demonstrate F# in a more realistic/practical context.

In order to focus on the F# language and demonstrate its compatibility with C#, we will also use C#.

This project implements the __[Functional Core/Imperative Shell architecture](https://www.kennethlange.com/functional-core-imperative-shell/)__ . In short it allows to separate _business constraints_ with _technical ones_ by getting rid of _side effects_ within the _business code_. This is not the focus of this workshop, so we won't get deeper into that. 

The project structure is as follow:
1. __src/ClockOrDie.WebApi__ which host the web api code, entirely in C#
2. __src/ClockOrDie.Core__ which host the business code, entirely in F#

TODO: add detailed explanations ? 

### Step 01

Using the [FSI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/tools/fsharp-interactive/) of your favourite IDE complete methods in the file _Step01-SaveActivities.fsx_ in the _ClockOrDie.Core_.
When all step have been completed, you can run the project, and using the swagger, you can call __admin/activities/{activity_name}__
